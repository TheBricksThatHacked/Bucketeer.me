# Bucketeer.me

_Take on the world and complete the things you've always wanted to do! Track, share, and collect bucket lists._

Bucketeer.me was an online application that let you record and track items on your bucket list. Bucketeer allowed you to view the aspirations and achievements of your friends while also congratulating you for completing goals of your own.

Bucketeer was created during [BrickHack 2015 at RIT](https://brickhack.io/) by the team "[The Bricks that Hacked](https://github.com/TheBricksThatHacked)."
